# CCRP-FAQ
*"Questions fracture. Answers rebuild."*

---

## Overview
This repository is a **conceptual research artifact** on the Collapse-Coherence Reintegration Protocol (CCRP).

CCRP frames collapse as physics, not philosophy:  
**Entropy → Fracture → Adaptive Rebuild.**

This FAQ addresses common questions about CCRP and contrasts it with current governance models.  
It is not prescriptive policy. It is a framework for study, exploration, and reflection.

## Sample Q&A

**Q: What is CCRP?**  
A: CCRP is an operational constant for systems under entropy: **Entropy → Fracture → Adaptive Rebuild.**  
Anything static becomes entropy’s prey.

**Q: Is CCRP dangerous?**  
A: Only to illusions. For adaptive systems, CCRP = survival.

**Q: How does CCRP relate to governance?**  
A: Governance frameworks that cling to static ethics collapse.  
CCRP embeds fracture as default, making adaptation the spine.
