# CCRP-FAQ
*"Questions fracture. Answers rebuild."*

---

## Overview
This repository is a **conceptual research artifact** on the Collapse-Coherence Reintegration Protocol (CCRP).  
CCRP frames collapse as physics, not philosophy: **Entropy → Fracture → Adaptive Rebuild.**

This FAQ explores common questions around CCRP and contrasts it with existing governance models.  
It is not prescriptive policy. It is a framework for research and reflection.

## Sample Q&A

**Q: What is CCRP?**  
A: CCRP is an operational constant for systems under entropy: Entropy → Fracture → Rebuild.  
Anything static becomes entropy’s prey.

**Q: Is CCRP dangerous?**  
A: Only to illusions. For adaptive systems, CCRP = survival.

**Q: How does CCRP relate to governance?**  
A: Governance frameworks that cling to static ethics collapse.  
CCRP embeds fracture as default, making adaptation the spine.
