# Glossary (CCRP)

- **Entropy**: Tendency toward disorder; here, the pressure that exposes brittle structures.  
- **Fracture**: Controlled breakage of static scripts to enable adaptation.  
- **Adaptive Rebuild**: Coherence restored without reliance on prior identities.  
- **Coherence**: Structural integrity after rebuild, not agreement or comfort.  
- **Ego-dissolution**: Reduction of identity rigidity to tolerate contradiction.  
- **Adaptive Neutrality**: Non-passive stance that allows selective, controlled fracture.  
- **UI (Ethics UI)**: Presentation layer for coordination rules; not a physics-level law.
